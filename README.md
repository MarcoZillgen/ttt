# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is written with next.js and TypeScript. I only quickly implemented the game logic and UI. The game is hopefully without any bugs :). There are sadly no tests, no docs, no dockerization, but it was just a simple fun project to play the game.
